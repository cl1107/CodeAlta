# CodeAltaApp Architecture Plan

Reference: [codealta_app_architecture_improvements.md](C:\code\CodeAlta\codealta_app_architecture_improvements.md)

This document is the implementation checklist companion to the architecture proposal. It is intentionally short and task-oriented.

## Phase 1: Remove `TerminalHost`

- [x] Add `CodeAltaApp.CreateAsync(...)` to own bootstrap and lifetime setup.
- [x] Move logging initialization/shutdown ownership into `CodeAltaApp` or a small bootstrap helper.
- [x] Move database/catalog/backend/runtime-service construction out of `TerminalHost`.
- [x] Move `ImportKnownProjectsFromBackendsAsync` into a dedicated collaborator such as `KnownProjectImporter`.
- [x] Update `Program.cs` to create and run `CodeAltaApp` directly.
- [x] Delete `src/CodeAlta/App/TerminalHost.cs`.

## Phase 2: Introduce explicit UI threading and shell coordination

- [x] Add `IUiDispatcher`.
- [x] Add `TerminalUiDispatcher`.
- [x] Add `CodeAltaShellController`.
- [x] Move startup loading and refresh orchestration from `CodeAltaApp` into `CodeAltaShellController`.
- [x] Move runtime event handling entry points into `CodeAltaShellController`.
- [x] Add a dedicated `RuntimeEventPump`.
- [x] Ensure runtime events are applied on the UI thread through `IUiDispatcher`.
- [ ] Remove duplicated UI-thread helper patterns over time (`PostToUi`, `ReadUiValue`, `RunOnUiThread`) in favor of the new dispatcher path.

## Phase 3: Extract real view classes

- [x] Create `CodeAltaShellView`.
- [x] Create `SidebarView`.
- [x] Create `ThreadWorkspaceView`.
- [x] Create `SessionUsagePopupView`.
- [x] Move shell layout construction out of `CodeAltaApp` partials and into view classes.
- [x] Move sidebar control creation and tree rebuild wiring into `SidebarView`.
- [x] Move thread-pane control creation and selector wiring into `ThreadWorkspaceView`.
- [ ] Keep `CodeAltaApp` focused on app lifecycle only.

## Phase 4: Introduce focused bindable view models

- [ ] Expand `CodeAltaShellViewModel`.
- [x] Add `SidebarViewModel`.
- [x] Add `ThreadWorkspaceViewModel`.
- [x] Add `ThreadTabViewModel`.
- [x] Add `PromptComposerViewModel`.
- [ ] Add `SessionUsageViewModel` if needed by the popup/presenter split.
- [x] Move shell/header/status/sidebar/workspace scalar state into bindable view models.
- [ ] Ensure all `[Bindable]` reads and writes happen on the UI thread only.
- [x] Remove command enablement logic that depends on direct control inspection when a view-model-based alternative is available.

## Phase 5: Split thread session state from visual state

- [x] Introduce `ThreadSessionState` as non-visual per-thread state.
- [x] Move history loading flags and cached history data into `ThreadSessionState`.
- [x] Move per-thread backend/model/reasoning/usage/status state into `ThreadSessionState` and `ThreadTabViewModel` as appropriate.
- [ ] Remove concrete controls from the current thread state bag.
- [x] Replace the current `ThreadTabState` with smaller focused types.

## Phase 6: Extract timeline and tool-call presenters

- [x] Create `ThreadTimelinePresenter`.
- [x] Create `ToolCallPresenter`.
- [x] Create `SessionUsagePresenter` if the usage popup remains presenter-driven.
- [x] Move `DocumentFlow` ownership into timeline presenters.
- [x] Move tool-call chip/dialog state into `ToolCallPresenter`.
- [x] Move incremental timeline rendering logic out of `CodeAltaApp`.
- [x] Keep imperative timeline rendering localized to presenters instead of spreading it through the shell/controller.

## Phase 7: Extract formatting and helper buckets

- [x] Create `ChatMarkdownFormatter`.
- [x] Create `ToolCallSummaryFormatter`.
- [x] Create `SessionUsageFormatter`.
- [x] Move status/usage/tool-call/chat formatting helpers out of `CodeAltaApp`.
- [x] Remove `CodeAltaApp.ChatHelpers.cs` as a generic helper bucket.
- [x] Remove remaining `CodeAltaApp` partial files that exist only to group unrelated helpers.

## Phase 8: Reduce broad refresh paths

- [ ] Replace broad `RefreshView()` usage with narrower update paths.
- [ ] Make sidebar updates driven by sidebar projection changes.
- [ ] Make tab-strip updates driven by open-tab and selected-tab changes.
- [ ] Make status/header updates driven by bindable state changes.
- [x] Make timeline updates incremental per event/history load.
- [x] Make usage popup updates target only the selected thread usage state.

## Phase 9: Rework tests around the new seams

- [ ] Add controller tests for selection, scope, status, and prompt availability.
- [ ] Add controller tests for startup restoration and runtime event application.
- [ ] Add projection tests for sidebar and tab-strip models/builders.
- [x] Add presenter-focused tests where they provide value.
- [ ] Keep a small number of real UI interaction tests for behavior that requires controls.
- [ ] Reduce reflection-heavy tests that poke private `CodeAltaApp` fields.

## Final cleanup

- [ ] Verify `CodeAltaApp` is no longer a large partial class spanning unrelated concerns.
- [ ] Verify `CodeAltaApp` owns lifecycle only and does not hold many concrete controls.
- [ ] Verify there is one explicit UI dispatcher contract in active use.
- [ ] Verify runtime events are applied through one shell/controller path on the UI thread.
- [ ] Verify bindable view models are only accessed on the UI thread.
- [ ] Verify timeline/tool-call/dialog logic lives outside the shell controller.
- [ ] Verify `ThreadTabState` is gone or reduced to one focused responsibility.
- [ ] Verify `RefreshView()` no longer exists as a broad shell refresh primitive.
- [ ] Update docs if the implementation materially changes structure or terminology.
