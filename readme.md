An agentic AI coding CLI assistant developed in .NET.

## ✨ Features

- Workspace descriptors and machine profile overrides (`CodeAlta.Workspaces`)
- Scope resolution and checkout planning APIs for multi-repo workspaces
- SQLite-backed durable state + migrations + repositories (`CodeAlta.Persistence`)
- Markdown artifact store with YAML frontmatter parsing and plain-text extraction
- FTS5 + embedding-backed hybrid search pipeline (`CodeAlta.Search`)
- In-process MCP server surface with tools for tasks, artifacts, search, workspaces, and agents (`CodeAlta.Mcp`)
- Agent orchestration services for role profiles, context packs, and planner/builder durable workflows (`CodeAlta.Orchestration`)
- .NET first-class services for workspace discovery, symbol indexing, context snippets, diagnostics, and index refresh (`CodeAlta.DotNet`)
- Interactive terminal shell wired to workspace/task/search/.NET/MCP services, with explicit shell-controller/UI-dispatcher/view-presenter seams, rich agent timelines, chat backend/model/reasoning selectors, a live `ctx --` / `ctx NN%` context-window indicator with normalized usage popup sections and backend-specific detail, and asynchronous Codex/Copilot probing so the TUI starts immediately even when a backend is missing (`CodeAlta`)
- Busy-thread prompt queueing with an editable waiting list, per-entry repeat counts, immediate steer conversion, and an `F10` clear-queue shortcut (`CodeAlta`)
- A temporary `AlwaysQueue` toggle beside `AutoScroll` lets you enqueue prompts on an idle selected thread to exercise the waiting-list UI without sending immediately (`CodeAlta`)
- Idle started threads can be compacted manually from the footer bar or with `F11`, using the thread's current backend/model/reasoning configuration (`CodeAlta`)
- Codex backend sessions default to no sandbox in CodeAlta, so prompts can inspect sibling projects outside the current working directory without requiring the session cwd to be moved first
- CodeAlta writes a persistent diagnostic log to `~/.codealta/logs/codealta.log` for chat/backend troubleshooting
- `CodeAlta --test` runs the real terminal app for a short smoke-test window and exits automatically after 10 seconds by default
- In-memory MCP transport tests for tool discovery and roundtrip tool calls
