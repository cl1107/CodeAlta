# Catalog, configuration, and state

CodeAlta keeps user-owned durable state under a global root and project-local `.alta` directories. The default global root is `~/.alta`, resolved from the current user's profile directory by `CodeAltaOwnedServices` and `CodeAltaHost` unless a host overrides it.

## Global root layout

`CatalogOptions` defines the current global layout:

| Path under `~/.alta` | Owner | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `config.toml` | `CodeAltaConfigStore` | Global chat defaults, providers, plugins, and ACP agent definitions. |
| `projects/` | `ProjectCatalog` | Markdown project descriptors keyed by project slug. |
| `checkouts/` | `ProjectCatalog` helpers | Default checkout root used by catalog planning APIs. |
| `machines/` | Catalog model | Machine-specific override profile root. |
| `agents/` | Catalog model | File-backed agent-definition root used by host-owned coordinator setup. |
| `cache/` | Process/runtime services | Machine-local cache root, including refreshed model metadata and plugin build cache. |
| `sessions/` | Local agent runtime and thread catalog | Date-sharded session journals and optional protocol traces. |
| `saved_prompts/` | Frontend prompt draft service | Unsent per-thread prompt drafts. |
| `ui-state.yaml` | Frontend view-state service | Open/selected tabs, thread/model preferences, theme, and shell view state. |
| `plugins/` | Plugin runtime | User-scoped source plugin packages. |
| `skills/` | Skill catalog | User-scoped CodeAlta skill roots. |
| `acp/registry/` | ACP registry service | Cached ACP registry document. |
| `acp/downloads/` | ACP installer | Download cache for installable ACP agents. |
| `acp/installs/` | ACP installer | Installed ACP agent payloads. |
| `acp/manifests/` | ACP installer/store | ACP install manifests. |
| `acp/state/` | ACP/backend integration | ACP-specific state files. |
| `threads/internal/` | Work-thread catalog | Internal thread linkage descriptors still read by the catalog. |

The runtime creates directories as needed. Provider auth managers also write under `~/.alta/auth/`, for example subscription credentials and direct-provider token caches. Protocol traces, session journals, auth files, and provider caches can contain prompts, tool arguments, model output, file paths, command output, or credentials; treat them as private user data.

## Project-local state

Project-local CodeAlta state lives under `<project>/.alta/`:

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `<project>/.alta/config.toml` | Project-local config overrides. |
| `<project>/.alta/plugins/<package-id>/plugin.cs` | Project-scoped trusted source plugin packages. |
| `<project>/.alta/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` | Project-scoped skills. |

The skill catalog also reads `<project>/.agents/skills/` and `~/.agents/skills/` as common `SKILL.md` roots. Use `.alta` roots when the content depends on CodeAlta-specific behavior.

## Configuration model

The top-level TOML document has four sections:

```toml
[chat]
default_provider = "my_provider"

[providers.my_provider]
type = "openai-responses"
enabled = true
model = "model-id"
api_key_env = "MY_PROVIDER_API_KEY"

[plugins.statistics]
enabled = true

[acp.agents.example]
agent_id = "example"
command = "example-agent"
args = ["--stdio"]
```

`CodeAltaConfigDocument` maps these sections to:

- `chat`: chat-level defaults, currently the default provider key;
- `providers`: configured model-provider documents keyed by provider key;
- `plugins`: plugin enablement keyed by built-in id or source package id;
- `acp.agents`: ACP backend definitions keyed by agent id.

Global config is loaded from `~/.alta/config.toml`. Project config is loaded from `<project>/.alta/config.toml` when a project scope is active. The provider-management UI edits the same global file and validates TOML before saving.

### Provider enablement

The bundled template is `src/CodeAlta.Catalog/DefaultConfig/config.toml`; all built-in provider entries are explicitly disabled there. For user-authored provider entries, an omitted `enabled` value normalizes to `true`.

Provider registrations are skipped at startup when required credentials or provider-specific authentication settings are missing. Skipped providers remain in config and can be corrected through the UI or TOML editor.

### Project overrides

Project-local config can override effective chat/provider behavior for that project. The frontend also persists thread-specific provider/model/reasoning selections in `ui-state.yaml`, so an existing thread can keep its selected runtime after global defaults change.

## Project catalog

`ProjectCatalog` stores project descriptors under `~/.alta/projects`. Current saves use flat `<slug>.md` files; the loader still reads older `<slug>/readme.md` descriptor paths so existing user state can be opened.

A project descriptor includes stable id, slug, display name, project path, archive/visibility state, and timestamps. Opening a folder upserts a descriptor for that path, then the shell selects it in the sidebar.

## Work-thread and session storage

CodeAlta uses two related records for active work:

- **Work-thread descriptors** are catalog/runtime metadata for global, project, and internal threads. They carry title, project reference, provider/model/reasoning preferences, parent/created-by attribution, and last-active timestamps.
- **Agent session journals** are local-runtime JSONL files under `~/.alta/sessions/yyyy/MM/dd/<session-id>.jsonl`. They contain replayable normalized `AgentEvent` records plus raw snapshot events for `local.sessionSummary`, `local.sessionState`, `codealta.threadHeader`, and `codealta.threadState`.

`WorkThreadJournalStore` reads and writes CodeAlta thread headers/state in the same journal used by the local agent runtime. This avoids maintaining separate provider-bound state files for the same thread.

Optional protocol traces are written to `~/.alta/sessions/traces/<session-id>.trace` only when a provider has tracing enabled. Credential headers are redacted, but trace files can still contain sensitive prompts, outputs, tool arguments, and streamed protocol updates.

## Prompt drafts and view state

Unsent per-thread prompts are stored under `~/.alta/saved_prompts/` so closing a tab or restarting the app does not discard edited drafts. The frontend stores view state in `~/.alta/ui-state.yaml`, including open/selected tabs, theme and navigator settings, and thread-specific model preferences.

`ShellStateStore` is a UI-thread projection of currently open shell state; it is not a replacement for the durable catalog, session journals, or runtime-owned thread state.

## ACP state

ACP install and runtime state is grouped under `~/.alta/acp/`:

- `registry/latest/registry.json` caches the downloaded registry document;
- `downloads/` stores downloaded archives or package payloads;
- `installs/` stores resolved install directories;
- `manifests/` and `state/` store install/runtime metadata;
- effective ACP backend definitions are merged from installed definitions and `[acp.agents]` config.

See [ACP integration](acp.md) for runtime capabilities and limits.

## Plugin and skill state

Source plugins are discovered from user and project roots and are enabled by default unless disabled in config or safe mode is active. CodeAlta owns generated plugin-root build files and plugin build manifests under its roots; plugin package directories should contain only package-owned source/content files.

Skills are plain directories containing `SKILL.md` plus optional helper files. Discovery validates metadata, applies precedence/shadowing, and reads resources without executing scripts.
