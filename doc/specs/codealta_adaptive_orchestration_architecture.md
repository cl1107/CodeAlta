# CodeAlta Adaptive Orchestration Architecture

Status: **Proposal**  
Audience: `CodeAlta`, `CodeAlta.Agent*`, `CodeAlta.Orchestration`, `CodeAlta.Workspaces`, `CodeAlta.Persistence`, UI, and future bootstrap/sync work.

Related specs:
- `doc/specs/filesystem_metadata_catalog_spec.md`
- `doc/specs/agent_api_specs.md`
- `doc/specs/agent_configuration_spec.md`

## 1. Why this document exists

CodeAlta has reached the point where the next important work is not another isolated feature. The next important work is clarifying the architecture around a few core ideas:

- portable, file-backed durable state
- orchestrator-owned routing and execution
- adaptive memory that is visible to the user
- background and proactive behavior
- backend-agnostic orchestration over Copilot and Codex

The analysis reinforced two conclusions:

1. the strongest product value comes from **durable visible working memory and team structure**
2. the strongest implementation choice is to keep orchestration in **host code**, not to delegate it entirely to model-native tool orchestration

This document reframes CodeAlta around those conclusions.

---

## 2. Core architecture decision

CodeAlta should be built around a **host-owned orchestrator** with a **filesystem-first portable catalog**.

That means:

- durable state lives in plain text under `~/.codealta/`
- machine-local operational state lives under `~/.codealta/machine/`
- the orchestrator, written in C#, owns routing, dispatch, lifecycle, and recovery
- Copilot and Codex are execution backends, not the owners of orchestration
- MCP is used for external tools and selected model-callable services, not as the main internal routing backbone

This is the architectural center of gravity for the project.

---

## 3. Design principles

## 3.1 Orchestrator-owned routing

The host decides:

- which agent(s) should receive work
- whether work is direct, background, coordinated, or review-oriented
- when to steer, retry, escalate, or recover
- when unfinished work should be resumed

Models may suggest routing decisions, but CodeAlta remains the authority.

## 3.2 Filesystem-first durable memory

Human-visible state is a product feature, not merely a debugging aid.

Durable memory should be:

- readable in a text editor
- versionable in git
- copyable across machines
- reviewable and adaptable by the user

Frontmatter and stable file contracts are used to keep this safe and machine-parseable.

## 3.3 Machine-local runtime state is not the source of truth

SQLite and caches remain important, but only for:

- indexes
- embeddings
- ephemeral coordination state
- rebuildable machine state

The user should be able to understand the durable system state without opening a database.

## 3.4 Adaptive behavior is a first-class goal

CodeAlta should learn:

- how the developer tends to work
- what the developer is currently focused on
- what work was recently active
- which patterns and preferences recur
- which agents or roles repeatedly become useful

The system should then react:

- propose continuation of recent work
- propose review/background checks
- suggest creating or refining agents/skills
- notice unfinished plans/tasks and resume them

## 3.5 Scope-first architecture

Everything is scoped:

- global
- workspace
- project
- task/plan
- artifact/activity

Scope determines:

- what memory is loaded
- what projects are available
- what agents can act
- what checkout paths apply
- what approvals and policies are valid

## 3.6 Backend-agnostic core

Copilot and Codex should not define CodeAlta's product model.

The core abstractions belong to CodeAlta:

- agents
- tasks
- plans
- route decisions
- interactions
- activity streams
- artifacts
- adaptive memory

Backends are adapters that implement execution semantics.

## 3.7 Park premature specialization

The .NET specialization is useful code, but it should not drive the near-term architecture.

Near-term priority should be:

- orchestration
- routing
- durable state
- adaptive memory
- workspace/project portability

Language-specific intelligence can remain available, but should not dominate current architecture decisions.

---

## 4. System model

CodeAlta should be understood as six connected layers.

## 4.1 Portable catalog

Location:

- `~/.codealta/`

Purpose:

- source of truth for durable metadata and durable human-visible memory

Contains:

- workspaces
- projects
- agents
- skills
- user/profile memory
- durable activity summaries
- durable artifacts and notes

This is the root folder CodeAlta should treat as the global operating context when it starts.

From `~/.codealta/`, CodeAlta should be able to:

- discover all known workspaces and projects
- resolve local checkout paths through machine overrides
- pick the active workspace/project scope
- load global agents and skills that apply across workspaces

## 4.2 Machine state

Location:

- `~/.codealta/machine/`

Purpose:

- local-only execution state and rebuildable caches

Contains:

- `codealta.db`
- logs
- indexes
- embedding caches
- machine-specific checkout overrides
- local runtime/session state

## 4.3 Orchestrator

Purpose:

- the host-owned execution brain

Responsibilities:

- route work
- create and steer sessions
- track plans/tasks
- schedule background work
- recover unfinished work
- collect activity
- update durable memory
- drive proactive suggestions

## 4.4 Agent sessions

Purpose:

- backend execution units

Backends:

- Copilot
- Codex

The orchestrator creates and manages sessions explicitly. Backend-native tooling is used where helpful, but session lifecycle remains CodeAlta-owned.

## 4.5 Tool and integration layer

Purpose:

- expose model-callable capabilities and external integrations

Examples:

- search
- task lookup
- artifact lookup
- project/workspace inspection
- external systems through MCP

This layer should not be the sole route by which agents coordinate with each other.

## 4.6 User interfaces

Purpose:

- present state
- gather approvals/input
- surface reasoning, routing, plans, tools, and background work

Important rule:

- the UI should present orchestration state, not own orchestration behavior

---

## 5. Core durable entities

The catalog should treat the following as first-class durable entities.

## 5.1 Workspace

A workspace is the durable scope of work across one or more projects.

It should define:

- identity
- purpose
- project references
- default agents
- checkout policy
- background routines

## 5.2 Project

A project is a durable definition of a codebase or codebase root.

It should define:

- repo identity and remote URL
- default branch
- checkout strategy
- machine override support
- project-specific notes and artifacts

## 5.3 Agent

An agent is a durable role definition.

It should define:

- role/purpose
- prompt/instructions
- preferred model/reasoning defaults
- relevant tools
- scope defaults
- collaboration/review expectations

Agents should be file-defined, including built-ins.

CodeAlta should support agents from both:

- the global catalog root under `~/.codealta/agents/`
- project-local overlays under `{projectPath}/.codealta/agents/`

Global agents manage cross-workspace and cross-project concerns. Project-local agents are repository-specific specializations or overrides.

## 5.4 Skill

A skill is a reusable instruction or capability pack that can be loaded on demand.

CodeAlta should support skills from both:

- the global catalog root under `~/.codealta/skills/`
- project-local overlays under `{projectPath}/.codealta/skills/`

Project-local skills allow repository-specific behavior without polluting the global catalog.

## 5.5 User profile

CodeAlta should add a durable user-profile entity.

This profile should capture:

- stable working preferences
- common conventions and directives
- recent focus areas
- preferred work rhythm
- prompting habits
- recurring project/workspace patterns

This profile is essential for adaptive behavior such as:

- “Do you want to continue working on X?”
- “You usually review PRs before continuing in this workspace.”
- “This kind of task often benefits from your reviewer agent.”

## 5.6 Task and plan

Tasks and plans are coordination records.

Not all task state needs to be portable, but the durable plan/task picture should be restorable and inspectable.

At minimum, CodeAlta should preserve:

- active plan structure
- unfinished tasks
- task ownership
- completion/blockage state
- links to artifacts and activity

## 5.7 Activity stream

Activity should be durable and human-inspectable.

Likely storage:

- JSONL activity streams plus durable markdown summaries

Activity should capture:

- session starts/ends
- route decisions
- task transitions
- approvals/interruptions
- artifact production
- review outcomes
- candidate learnings
- proactive suggestions made/accepted/rejected

## 5.8 Artifact

Artifacts are durable outputs such as:

- summaries
- plans
- notes
- reports
- decision records
- review findings
- retrieval snapshots

Artifacts should live near the entity that owns them:

- workspace
- project
- occasionally global catalog

---

## 6. Routing and execution model

## 6.1 Route decisions are explicit objects

CodeAlta should model routing as explicit data, not only as prompt text.

A route decision should answer:

- who should do the work
- whether the work is direct or coordinated
- whether it should run now or later
- whether review/verification is required
- why this route was chosen

The orchestrator may ask a model to suggest this, but the result should be normalized into a typed structure before execution.

## 6.2 Parsed-output orchestration is preferred over tool-driven orchestration

The default orchestration strategy should be:

1. ask the model/coordinator to propose a route or plan
2. parse and validate that output
3. execute the route in host code

This is preferred because it gives CodeAlta control over:

- actual parallelism
- retry behavior
- backpressure
- timeouts
- escalation
- review/competition policies
- recovery of unfinished work

This is stronger than relying on backend-native subagent/tool orchestration to decide those behaviors.

## 6.3 Direct send, steer, enqueue

CodeAlta should support:

- `send`: normal unit of work
- `steer`: interruptive correction/redirection
- `enqueue`: queued work managed by CodeAlta when a session becomes suitable/idle

The important point is that `enqueue` belongs primarily to CodeAlta orchestration, not to backend-specific semantics.

## 6.4 Parallelism is orchestrator-managed

CodeAlta should decide how much parallelism to use.

Examples:

- one planner + one implementer + one reviewer
- two competing implementers for high-risk design work
- background PR review while foreground coding continues

This should not depend on whether Copilot or Codex happens to parallelize a particular tool internally.

## 6.5 Review, challenge, and competition

CodeAlta should support patterns such as:

- mandatory reviewer after builder completion
- challenger agent that tries to falsify a design/result
- paired competing agents where CodeAlta compares outputs
- verification agent for tests/builds/spec compliance

These are orchestration policies, not agent-specific hacks.

## 6.6 Unfinished work recovery

One major requirement is preventing work from silently stopping mid-plan.

CodeAlta should track:

- tasks still in progress
- tasks blocked on approvals or input
- plans with incomplete items
- stale work that has not advanced recently

The orchestrator should then:

- resume when appropriate
- surface unfinished work clearly
- propose continuation
- create follow-up tasks/reviews automatically where policy allows

---

## 7. Adaptive memory and proactive behavior

This is a major addition beyond the current direction.

## 7.1 What CodeAlta should learn

From the developer:

- style and conventions
- recent focus
- project cadence
- review habits
- tolerance for interruptions/background work
- preferred agent patterns

From the agents:

- recurring problem domains
- repeated need for new specialists
- patterns in review failures
- work that often gets left unfinished
- good challenge/reviewer patterns

From the workspace/project:

- active branches/PRs/issues
- recent activity timestamps
- open review needs
- stalled plans/tasks
- recurring maintenance work

## 7.2 What CodeAlta should do with that memory

It should be able to react with suggestions such as:

- “You worked on workspace X yesterday; continue that plan?”
- “There is an open PR in project Y; review in background?”
- “This workspace repeatedly needs security review; create a security agent?”
- “The previous plan stopped after step 3; resume or close it?”

## 7.3 Human-visible adaptive memory

Adaptive memory should not be buried entirely in SQLite.

There should be durable human-visible records for:

- current focus
- recent focus history
- accepted/rejected suggestions
- stable user preferences
- inferred working patterns once confirmed

This keeps the system inspectable and adaptable.

## 7.4 Confirmation boundary

CodeAlta should distinguish:

- observed behavior
- inferred behavior
- confirmed durable preference

Not every observation should become a stable rule automatically.

Good model:

- observe frequently
- infer cautiously
- persist confirmed preferences deliberately

---

## 8. Portable checkout and multi-machine model

CodeAlta should treat `~/.codealta/` as a portable catalog that can be cloned on another machine.

That means checkout behavior must be first-class.

## 8.1 Portable project definition

Portable project metadata should define:

- remote URL
- branch defaults
- preferred checkout template
- workspace attachment

## 8.2 Machine-local overrides

Machine-local config should define:

- base checkout roots per OS or machine
- per-project override paths
- opt-out rules for projects not present on this machine

Examples:

- Windows default root: `C:\code`
- Linux/macOS default root: `~/code`
- workspace `xyz` default path: `C:\code\xyz`

## 8.3 Bootstrap behavior

On a new machine, CodeAlta should be able to:

1. clone or open `~/.codealta/`
2. read machine-local overrides
3. resolve project/workspace checkout paths
4. clone/fetch repos
5. rebuild machine-local indexes
6. restore active durable context

This should become a first-class product capability, not a manual setup detail.

---

## 9. Role of MCP in the revised architecture

MCP remains useful, but it is no longer the center of the design.

## 9.1 What MCP should do

MCP is good for:

- external services
- rich search or memory query surfaces
- selected CodeAlta tools exposed uniformly to backends
- integrations that are naturally tool-shaped

## 9.2 What MCP should not own

MCP should not be the primary owner of:

- agent-to-agent routing
- orchestration lifecycle
- task scheduling
- unfinished work recovery
- adaptive behavior policy

Those belong in CodeAlta host code.

---

## 10. Near-term architectural priorities

The next priority order should be:

1. simplify and strengthen orchestration
2. finalize the portable catalog and machine-state split
3. add durable activity/focus/adaptive memory
4. add workspace/project checkout logic
5. improve proactive/background behavior
6. only then deepen search and language specialization

The .NET specialization should remain available but should not be the main design driver right now.

---

## 11. Implications for the current codebase

## 11.1 `CodeAlta.Agent`

Should remain the shared backend/session abstraction, but should stay narrow and execution-focused.

## 11.2 `CodeAlta.Orchestration`

Should become the authoritative owner of:

- route decisions
- task/plan lifecycle
- background work scheduling
- review/challenge policies
- unfinished work recovery
- proactive suggestions

## 11.3 `CodeAlta.Workspaces`

Should own:

- portable catalog loading
- workspace/project descriptors
- checkout resolution
- machine overrides
- bootstrap/sync planning

## 11.4 `CodeAlta.Persistence`

Should focus on:

- indexes
- embeddings
- ephemeral runtime storage
- durable activity caches where appropriate

not as the source of truth for durable metadata.

## 11.5 UI

The UI should surface:

- active scope
- current and unfinished work
- background activity
- proactive suggestions
- review/challenge flows
- adaptive prompts such as continuation suggestions

but should not own orchestration policy.

---

## 12. Final position

CodeAlta should evolve into a **portable, adaptive, host-orchestrated coding companion**.

Its defining characteristics should be:

- visible durable memory
- portable filesystem catalog
- orchestrator-owned routing and recovery
- backend-agnostic execution
- adaptive suggestions based on recent and historical work
- strong workspace/project awareness

This is the clearest path to a system that is more durable, more inspectable, and more capable than a thin wrapper around Copilot or Codex.
