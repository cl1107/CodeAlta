# CodeAlta Blueprint (Draft)

Last updated: **2026-02-28**

This document is the high-level blueprint for **CodeAlta**: a local-first, multi-backend, multi-agent coding assistant intended to work on real projects (multiple folders, multiple repositories, long-lived sessions) despite limited model context windows (typically **200K–400K tokens**).

This is a “why/what” blueprint, not a full protocol spec. Detailed designs live in the companion documents:

- `doc/specs/agent_api_specs.md` (shared backend/session API for Codex + Copilot)
- `doc/specs/blueprint_agentic_coding_specs.md` (agent hierarchy, orchestration, memory/context strategy)
- `doc/specs/blueprint_mcp_server_specs.md` (built-in MCP server: agent registry, tasks DB, semantic search, skills)

## 1. Problem statement

Agentic coding systems fail in predictable ways:

- **Context limits**: a single session cannot hold a whole multi-project codebase + history + decisions.
- **Lack of grounding**: without compilers/indexers, agents hallucinate APIs and miss cross-project breakage.
- **Lack of continuity**: decisions and rejected approaches are forgotten between runs.
- **Single-thread bottleneck**: one agent doing planning + searching + building is slow and brittle.

CodeAlta’s direction is to make these failures *system problems* solved by architecture:

- Multiple workspaces + persistent knowledge store + semantic retrieval.
- Multiple specialized agents coordinated by shared state (tasks/plans).
- A built-in MCP server exposing stable services/tools to all agents.

---

## 2. Goals and non-goals

### Goals (what we want)

- **Multiple workspaces** with a global registry (the app knows them all).
- **Workspace switching** without losing running sessions, task state, or high-level context.
- **Hierarchical agents**:
  - global agent (user entry point)
  - knowledge/planner/builder agents at global/workspace/project scopes
- **Shared task/plan tracking** stored in SQLite and accessible via MCP services.
- **Semantic search** over files, symbols, git history, agent discussions, tasks/decisions.
- **Skills integration** (Agent Skills format) with progressive disclosure to avoid bloating context windows.

### Non-goals (first cut)

- Perfect 1:1 feature parity between Copilot and Codex backends.
- Distributed multi-user collaboration (can be added later; design should not block it).
- Indexing “the entire internet”; we focus on workspace-local and repo-local knowledge.

---

## 3. Design principles

- **Local-first, auditable**: store state on disk (SQLite + files), keep an audit trail of agent actions.
- **Memory-aware by default**: everything should support progressive disclosure and context budgets.
- **Grounded outputs**: prefer compiler/indexer facts and citations over free-form guesses.
- **Scope-first**: every operation is scoped (global/workspace/project/file) to reduce mistakes.
- **Extensible backends**: Codex/Copilot are backends; everything else is CodeAlta-owned logic.
- **Safe execution**: file changes and command execution go through explicit approval policies.

---

## 4. Core concepts

### 4.1 Workspace

A workspace is a named collection of projects plus settings.

Key constraints:

- A **project cannot belong to more than one workspace at a time**.
- Users can switch workspaces without losing current context (sessions/tasks remain).

Suggested identity:

- `workspaceId` (GUID)
- `name`
- `projects[]` (list of project roots and metadata)
- `settings` (backend preferences, indexing options, skill directories, etc.)

### 4.2 Project

A project is a folder root with detected type(s) and optional graph edges:

- `dotnet` solution/project graph
- `node` package graph
- `git` repo metadata

Projects are the unit for:

- indexing boundaries (file watchers, symbol extraction)
- permission boundaries (allowed roots)

### 4.3 Agent

An agent is a long-lived unit of work with an identity and scope.

- `agentId` (GUID)
- `role` (knowledge / planner / builder / reviewer / …)
- `scope` (global / workspace / project)
- `backend` (Codex/Copilot) + backend session/thread id
- `capabilities[]` (declared services/tools it can provide)

### 4.4 Task and plan

Tasks are first-class, durable coordination primitives:

- hierarchical (parent/child)
- assignable to agents
- scoped to workspace/project/file
- status tracked (`pending`, `in_progress`, `blocked`, `done`, …)

Tasks live in SQLite (via MCP service), not in an agent’s ephemeral memory.

### 4.5 Knowledge record

A knowledge record is an indexed unit that can be retrieved later, always with a source link:

- file slice (path + line range + hash)
- symbol (fully-qualified name + signature)
- git commit / diff / blame snippet
- conversation anchor (sessionId + messageId)
- task / decision entry

### 4.6 Agent artifacts (disk)

Compaction-safe continuity requires that agent outputs are not only “in the chat”.

For planner/knowledge (and optionally builder) outputs, store durable artifacts as plain files on disk:

- Markdown summaries (workspace/project/file)
- Plans and task breakdowns
- Decision records
- Retrieval snapshots (“why this was suggested”)
- Agent run logs (what tools were called, high-level outcomes)

These artifacts should be stored in a way that supports **portability** and **review**:

- **Project-scoped, shareable artifacts**: store under a repo-local folder (similar to `.github`):
  - `<projectRoot>/.codealta/`
  - these can be committed when you want knowledge to travel with the repository
- **User/workspace-scoped or sensitive artifacts**: store under a central per-user root:
  - Linux/macOS: `$HOME/.codealta/`
  - Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.codealta\`

To keep artifacts machine-readable, prefer **Markdown files with YAML frontmatter** (similar to Agent Skills’ `SKILL.md` and optionally project `AGENTS.md`).
Example:

```md
---
id: 9f8b3ad1-0d6f-4e4b-a7e0-6b2e6d1f4c8a
type: project_summary
projectId: <projectId>
workspaceId: <workspaceId>
createdAt: 2026-02-28T12:34:56Z
tags: [architecture, onboarding]
---

# Project summary
...
```

The SQLite DB stores metadata + pointers to these files (path + hash), so agents can reload them after compaction.

### 4.7 Skill

Skills follow the **Agent Skills** format: a directory with `SKILL.md` + optional `scripts/`, `references/`, `assets/`.

Skills must be integrated with **progressive disclosure**:

- load only metadata (name + description) globally
- load full instructions only when activated

---

## 5. High-level architecture

At a high level:

```
User (CLI/TUI/IDE)
   │
   ▼
Global Orchestrator (CodeAlta)
   │   ├─ Agent backends (Codex, Copilot) via CodeAlta.Agent API
   │   ├─ Built-in MCP server (tools/services)
   │   ├─ Workspace registry + switcher
   │   └─ Knowledge store (SQLite) + indexers (Roslyn, Git, embeddings)
   ▼
Workspace/Project Agents (knowledge/planner/builder)
```

The key idea is **separating concerns**:

- backends provide chat/session execution
- CodeAlta provides memory, orchestration, persistence, and tooling

---

## 6. Multi-workspace model

Requirements:

- The app maintains a **global registry** of workspaces (`workspaceId`, `name`, `projects`, settings).
- Switching workspaces:
  - does not delete/lose sessions or tasks
  - changes the “active scope” for commands and prompts
- Projects:
  - are unique-membership (one workspace only)
  - can be added/removed (with indexing updates)

Recommended approach:

- Store the workspace registry in a global config file + global SQLite table.
- Each workspace has its own SQLite DB (or a workspace namespace in a single DB).
- The global agent routes user requests to the right workspace agent(s).

Portability note (multi-machine):

- For teams or multi-device usage, consider making “workspace metadata” live in a **workspace repository**:
  - a git repo containing workspace manifests (YAML/Markdown) and curated knowledge artifacts
  - CodeAlta can clone/sync this repo to reconstruct workspaces on a different machine

---

## 7. Memory window strategy

The system must treat the context window as a scarce resource.

Core tactics:

- **Hierarchical summaries** (global → workspace → project → file/symbol).
- **Retrieval-first**: fetch only what is relevant (semantic + keyword + graph-based).
- **Pinned context**: users/agents can pin notes/files into the “always include” set.
- **Lazy materialization**: prefer manifests and symbol summaries over full file contents.
- **Session compaction**: summarize and store durable outcomes (decisions/tasks/anchors) after each run.

Implementation details are in `doc/specs/blueprint_agentic_coding_specs.md`.

---

## 8. Agent hierarchy

We want a consistent hierarchy across scopes:

- **Global agent**: user entry point, routes work, maintains cross-workspace awareness.
- **Knowledge agents**: answer questions with the right abstraction level.
  - global: knows all workspaces (structure + summaries)
  - workspace: knows projects and their shape
  - project: knows files/symbols and local decisions
- **Planner agents**: create/maintain plans and tasks.
  - global: multi-workspace plans
  - workspace: multi-project plans
  - project: file-level plans
- **Builder agents**: execute tasks (code changes, tests, refactors) within their scope.

Coordination primitives:

- tasks/plans in SQLite (shared state)
- MCP services for queries and actions
- event stream for progress updates (tasks, indexing, agent status)

---

## 9. Built-in MCP server

CodeAlta should embed an MCP server to provide a shared services layer.

Key responsibilities:

- **Agent registry**: agents register with id/name/description/capabilities; parent/child relationships.
- **Inter-agent communication**: request/response + publish/subscribe (task updates, indexing progress).
- **Task/plan service** backed by SQLite.
- **Semantic search service** backed by SQLite + embeddings.
- **Skills service** (discover, activate, validate skills).

Detailed tool/API surface is in `doc/specs/blueprint_mcp_server_specs.md`.

---

## 10. Storage, indexing, semantic search

### 10.1 Storage

Primary store: **SQLite** (local, portable, transactional).

In addition, use a **disk artifact store** for human-readable, compaction-safe documents (Markdown).
The DB links to artifacts rather than duplicating large derived text blobs.

At minimum, store:

- workspaces, projects, files
- agent sessions (metadata), conversation anchors
- tasks/plans and their history
- indexed knowledge records (with citations)
- embeddings vectors + search indexes
- artifact pointers (paths + hashes) for plans/summaries/decision records

### 10.2 Indexing sources

- Files (chunked + hashed)
- Symbols (Roslyn, where applicable)
- Git metadata (status/diff/log/blame; commit history as retrievable knowledge)
- Agent conversations and task logs
- Agent artifacts (plans/summaries/decisions) stored under `.codealta/` and `$HOME/.codealta/`

### 10.3 Full-text search (SQLite FTS5)

In addition to semantic retrieval, we should support **fast exact/keyword search** across all indexed documents using SQLite’s **FTS5** module.

Rationale:

- Developers often need exact identifier matching (symbols, file names, error messages)
- FTS5 is a strong prefilter for embeddings (reduce candidate sets)
- Full-text search is easier to audit than purely semantic retrieval

What should be searchable:

- agent artifacts (plans/summaries/decisions) from `.codealta/` and `$HOME/.codealta/`
- file chunks and extracted symbol text (where available)
- task comments and decision records
- conversation anchors (when indexed)

### 10.4 Semantic retrieval

Use embeddings to retrieve relevant knowledge records:

- small local embedding model via **LlamaSharp** (download + cache + integrity check)
- vector storage in SQLite (BLOB) plus a query strategy:
  - start: brute-force cosine over a filtered candidate set (FTS5 prefilter)
  - later: add a SQLite vector extension (e.g. sqlite-vec or sqlite-vss) when packaging is proven

### 10.5 Keeping it fresh

We need explicit invalidation strategies:

- file watchers re-index on change
- git branch/checkout detection triggers targeted re-indexing
- background jobs with rate limits (avoid thrashing on large repos)

---

## 11. Skills integration

We should integrate the Agent Skills format as a first-class concept:

- configure one or more skill directories per workspace
- load only `(name, description, path)` metadata into agent context
- activation loads full `SKILL.md` + referenced resources on demand

A dedicated **Skiller agent** can:

- manage skills discovery/validation
- decide which skills to activate (reducing load on other agents)
- keep a “skills index” in SQLite for fast matching

---

## 12. Roadmap (suggested)

A pragmatic, value-first order:

1. **Workspace registry + switching** (no semantic search yet).
2. **Tasks DB + MCP task service** (make plans durable and queryable).
3. **Indexing v1**: file hashes + FTS5 + basic chunks (keyword retrieval).
4. **Embeddings + semantic search v1**: small model + retrieval with citations.
5. **Agent hierarchy** (knowledge/planner/builder) backed by tasks/search.
6. **Roslyn host + speculative edit loop** for “always compiles” guarantees (for C#).
7. Skills integration + Skiller agent (progressive disclosure).

---

## 13. Open questions

- One SQLite DB per workspace vs a single DB with workspace namespaces?
- How do we represent cross-workspace tasks safely (explicit user opt-in)?
- Which SQLite vector strategy is shippable on Windows/macOS/Linux without pain?
- What is the minimal viable set of MCP tools to unblock multi-agent work?
- How do we persist “user intent” and “coding standards” per workspace/project?
