# CodeAlta User Guide

An agentic AI coding CLI assistant developed in .NET.

## Infrastructure Status

Current infrastructure-first progress includes workspace bootstrapping primitives:

- `CodeAlta.Workspaces`: workspace/project descriptors, machine override profiles, catalog loading.
- Scope resolution (`global`, `workspace`, `project`) into concrete checkout and `.codealta` roots.
- Checkout planning (`clone` vs `update`) without network side effects.
- `CodeAlta.Persistence`: SQLite migrations, task/artifact/agent repositories, and markdown artifact store.

## Workspace Descriptor Layout

Global repository layout (implemented reader support):

- `workspaces/<workspaceKey>/workspace.yaml`
- `workspaces/<workspaceKey>/projects/*.yaml`
- `machines/<machineId>.yaml`

The YAML model uses UUID v7 strings for workspace/project `id` values and validates
workspace/project keys using `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9\\-_.]{1,63}$`.

## Persistence Model

The persistence layer currently provides:

- SQLite schema bootstrap with `schema_version` migration tracking.
- Durable tables for `tasks`, `task_events`, `artifacts`, `artifact_links`, `agents`, and `agent_sessions`.
- Search foundation tables: `documents`, `documents_fts` (FTS5), and `document_embeddings`.
- Markdown artifact read/write with YAML frontmatter (`ArtifactStore`) and plain-text extraction for indexing.

## Indexing and Search

Current search infrastructure (`CodeAlta.Search`) includes:

- `IndexingQueue` + `Indexer` for background-capable indexing jobs.
- `DocumentIndexStore` to upsert documents, maintain FTS rows, and persist embeddings.
- `SearchService` with:
  - FTS query mode
  - hybrid mode (FTS prefilter + vector rerank).
- A deterministic local `HashEmbedder` for tests and offline indexing.
- `LlamaSharpEmbedder` for local GGUF-based embeddings when a model path is configured.

## In-process MCP Server

Current MCP infrastructure (`CodeAlta.Mcp`) includes:

- `CodeAltaMcpServerFactory` for building stream-transport MCP servers from internal services.
- `InProcessMcpConnection` for in-memory client/server transport wiring used by tests and internal callers.
- MCP tool sets:
  - `codealta.tasks.*` for durable task CRUD, notes, and markdown exports.
  - `codealta.artifacts.*` for markdown artifact write/read/list/link operations.
  - `codealta.search.*` for indexing, hybrid query, and queue status.
  - `codealta.workspaces.*` for workspace listing/getting/scope resolution.
  - `codealta.agents.*` for agent registry register/update/list operations.
- MSTest coverage for:
  - in-process tool discovery (`ListTools`)
  - task create/get roundtrip
  - indexed search query returning artifact-backed sources.

## Agent Orchestration

Current orchestration infrastructure (`CodeAlta.Orchestration`) includes:

- Identity and scope primitives for orchestrated agents (`AgentIdentity`, `AgentScope`, `AgentScopeKind`).
- `RoleProfileStore` for parsing role markdown from frontmatter-based and Copilot-style role files.
- `ContextPackBuilder` with provider composition and strict character-budget enforcement.
- `PlannerService` for durable plan creation:
  - root + child task creation in SQLite
  - persisted `plan.output` markdown artifacts.
- `BuilderService` for task completion and persisted `builder.verification` artifacts.
- `AgentHub` runtime for backend-agnostic agent registration, session lifecycle, and run event emission.

## .NET First-class Services

Current `.NET` infrastructure (`CodeAlta.DotNet`) includes:

- `DotNetWorkspaceService` for discovering `.sln`/`.slnx` and project files (`.csproj`, `.fsproj`, `.vbproj`).
- `SymbolIndexService` using Roslyn syntax trees to index:
  - namespaces
  - types
  - members (methods, properties, fields) with file line ranges.
- `DotNetContextProvider` for compact symbol/file snippets with stable source links (`file://...#Lx`).
- `DotNetDiagnosticsService` for `dotnet build` execution with persisted diagnostics artifacts and search indexing.
- `DotNetIndexService` for refreshing project-graph and symbol knowledge artifacts and indexing them.
- Fixture-backed MSTest coverage for:
  - tiny solution discovery
  - symbol lookup path/range validation
  - symbol context source-link generation
  - refresh-index and diagnostics artifact persistence.
