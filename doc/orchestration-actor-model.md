# Lightweight orchestration actor model

CodeAlta orchestration uses small internal mailbox actors rather than a general actor framework. The goal is single-writer per-thread mutation, bounded event flow, and testable shutdown/error behavior without exposing actor concepts through public APIs.

## Ownership boundaries

- Public callers use `IWorkThreadOrchestrator`/runtime request records, thread ids, snapshots, handles, and events.
- `WorkThreadActor`, `WorkThreadActorRegistry`, and `OrchestrationMailboxActor` are internal implementation details.
- A thread actor owns same-thread command ordering, lifecycle cancellation, supervisor decisions, and mailbox cleanup.
- Different thread actors may run independently; commands for one thread are serialized.
- Frontend and plugin code must not mutate actor-owned state directly. Async completions and observer results are converted into commands/events first.

## Command and event naming

- Mutating runtime APIs use named request records and return structured command results.
- Orchestration events use stable thread ids and optional per-thread sequence numbers for frontend/plugin projection idempotency.
- Lifecycle events identify session/run/queue transitions without requiring frontend tab state.
- Plugin-derived events are transient projections; they do not become canonical persisted transcript entries.

## Plugin orchestration bridge

- Plugin orchestration hooks live behind orchestration-layer adapter services, not in the TUI frontend.
- Agent-event observers receive normalized `AgentEvent` values with project/thread/run scope and are dispatched in deterministic plugin order.
- Derived event projections use one replay/live path so restored events and newly observed events produce equivalent plugin projection output.
- Plugin observer/projection failures are diagnosed and isolated from the actor command path and from later plugins.

## Mailbox and backpressure

- `OrchestrationMailboxActor` uses a bounded channel and completes command replies on validation failures, recoverable handler failures, disposal, and unrecoverable supervisor stops.
- `BoundedRuntimeEventStream<TEvent>` uses a bounded channel with a newest-event drop policy when readers fall behind; dropped events are counted for diagnostics.
- Callers must not depend on unbounded buffering to preserve UI responsiveness or plugin observer progress.

## Supervisor decisions

- Validation failures fail the current command without stopping the actor.
- Recoverable handler/backend/plugin failures are represented as structured command outcomes where possible.
- Unrecoverable failures stop the actor, complete pending replies, and allow the registry to clean up the actor entry.

## Actor framework decision

Akka.NET is intentionally not a default dependency. The local mailbox primitives keep public APIs framework-neutral and minimize runtime surface area. Reconsider a full actor framework only after tests and measured complexity show that the local primitives no longer simplify orchestration ownership, supervision, testing, shutdown, and host integration.
