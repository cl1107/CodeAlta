# Plugins

CodeAlta plugins are trusted source packages that can extend the shell, prompt flow, agent runtime, timeline projections, and the in-session `alta` live tool.

Plugins are for local automation you choose to run. Building a source plugin can execute SDK/NuGet/MSBuild logic, and loading it executes .NET code inside the CodeAlta process.

## Plugin locations

CodeAlta discovers dynamic source plugins from:

- `~/.alta/plugins/<package-id>/plugin.cs` for global plugins;
- `<project>/.alta/plugins/<package-id>/plugin.cs` for project-scoped plugins.

Project-scoped plugins apply only to the matching project. Global plugins apply across workspaces.

## Manage plugins

Open plugin management with `Ctrl+G Ctrl+N`, `/plugins`, or `/plugin`.

<!-- screenshot: plugin management dialog plugin list and selected plugin diagnostics -->

The dialog shows:

- plugin scope and state;
- diagnostics from discovery, config, build, load, activation, contributions, callbacks, source changes, and unload;
- contribution summaries;
- unknown config entries;
- source and README open actions when available.

You can also use a headless status summary:

```sh
alta --plugins-status
```

## Disable or bypass plugins

Source plugins are enabled by default when discovered. Disable a plugin in TOML when you do not want it built or loaded:

```toml
[plugins.HelloWorld]
enabled = false
```

When a plugin is broken, start CodeAlta with a bypass:

```sh
alta --no-plugins
alta --plugin-safe-mode
```

Or set:

```sh
CODEALTA_DISABLE_PLUGINS=1
```

These bypasses are recognized before plugin-contributed command-line options.

## Minimal source plugin

Create `~/.alta/plugins/HelloWorld/plugin.cs`:

```csharp
using CodeAlta.Plugins.Abstractions;
using XenoAtom.Terminal.UI.Controls;
using CliCommand = XenoAtom.CommandLine.Command;

[Plugin(DisplayName = "Hello Plugin", Description = "Adds a command, prompt note, and status row.")]
public sealed class HelloPlugin : PluginBase
{
    public override IEnumerable<PluginCommandContribution> GetCommands()
    {
        yield return Command.Prompt(
            "hello",
            "Show a hello notification.",
            static async (context, cancellationToken) =>
            {
                await context.Ui.NotifyAsync("Hello from a plugin.", cancellationToken);
                return PluginCommandResult.Handled;
            });
    }

    public override IEnumerable<PluginSystemPromptContribution> GetSystemPromptContributions()
    {
        yield return Prompt.Developer("When the user asks about the hello plugin, explain that it is installed.");
    }

    public override IEnumerable<XenoAtom.CommandLine.CommandNode> GetCommandLineContributions()
    {
        yield return new CliCommand("hello", "Run hello plugin command-line actions.");
    }

    public override IEnumerable<PluginUiContribution> GetUiContributions()
    {
        yield return PluginUi.Status("Hello", static _ => "hello plugin active");
        yield return PluginUi.Visual(PluginUiRegion.ThreadFooter, static _ => new Markup("[dim]Hello plugin[/]"));
    }
}
```

Restart CodeAlta or refresh plugin state from the management UI. CodeAlta generates the plugin-root build files it owns and invokes `dotnet build plugin.cs` from the plugin package directory.

## What plugins can contribute

Plugins can contribute:

- startup hooks and command-line commands;
- shell, prompt, and thread commands;
- UI visuals, status rows, dialogs, and renderers;
- prompt processors and system/developer prompt parts;
- before-agent-run hooks;
- LLM-callable agent tools and tool-call/result interception;
- provider factories;
- plugin-lifetime background tasks;
- resource roots such as skills, prompts, templates, themes, MCP manifests, and agent definitions;
- compaction hooks;
- normalized agent event observers;
- transient thread event projections for plugin-owned timeline cards.

Built-in plugins use the same model. For example, the statistics plugin projects per-turn/session statistics from normalized agent events without writing plugin messages into canonical conversation history.

## Extend the `alta` live tool

Plugins can add in-session live-tool command roots by returning `PluginAltaCommandContribution` records from `PluginBase.GetAltaCommands()`.

Those commands appear in:

```text
alta --help
alta tool capability list
```

Trusted plugins can also invoke built-in `alta` commands through `Services.Alta.InvokeAsync(...)`. Mutating plugin-originated commands include the plugin key in provenance so later sidebars, timelines, and reports can explain who created or submitted work.

## Safe authoring notes

- Use `Services.Tasks.Run(...)` or the `PluginBase.Tasks` shortcut for background work so CodeAlta can cancel and track plugin tasks during unload.
- Keep plugin package roots simple. For v1 source-folder plugins, do not add your own root `Directory.Build.props`, `Directory.Build.targets`, `Directory.Packages.props`, or `global.json`.
- Plugin-owned dependencies should be copied by the SDK (`EnableDynamicLoading=true`) so the plugin load context can resolve them.
- Avoid untracked background work, static references to host objects, pinned native resources, or host-static delegates that can prevent unload.
