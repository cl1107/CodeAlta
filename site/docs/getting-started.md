# Getting Started

## Install

CodeAlta is distributed as a .NET global tool. The package id is `CodeAlta`; the installed command is `alta`.

```sh
dotnet tool install -g CodeAlta
```

To update later:

```sh
dotnet tool update -g CodeAlta
```

Then launch the terminal UI:

```sh
alta
```

CodeAlta stores user state under `~/.alta/`, including configuration, logs, cached provider state, session journals, saved prompts, plugins, and skills.

## First launch

On first launch, CodeAlta creates a starter `~/.alta/config.toml` with common provider entries disabled. If no provider is enabled yet, the app opens the Model Providers dialog automatically.

Use the dialog to:

1. Select a provider entry on the left.
2. Enable it.
3. Choose or confirm the model and reasoning effort.
4. Add credentials through an API-key environment variable, direct API key, or provider login flow.
5. Click **Test** to validate credentials and model discovery.
6. Click **Save** to write `~/.alta/config.toml` and refresh the runtime.

You can reopen this dialog any time with `Ctrl+G Ctrl+R` or from the provider summary in the footer.

## Configure one provider quickly

For OpenAI platform access, set an environment variable and enable the default OpenAI provider:

```sh
# macOS/Linux
export CODEALTA_OPENAI_API_KEY="..."

# PowerShell
$env:CODEALTA_OPENAI_API_KEY = "..."
```

In `~/.alta/config.toml`:

```toml
[chat]
default_provider = "openai"

[providers.openai]
enabled = true
display_name = "OpenAI"
type = "openai-responses"
model = "gpt-5.5"
reasoning_effort = "high"
api_key_env = "CODEALTA_OPENAI_API_KEY"
api_url = "https://api.openai.com/v1"
```

The in-app dialog edits the same file and preserves advanced TOML values.

## Send a first prompt

1. Open a project with `Ctrl+O`, `/open`, or the `+` button in the Projects sidebar row.
2. Select the provider/model/reasoning combination in the footer if needed.
3. Type a prompt in the prompt editor.
4. Press `Enter` to send. Use `Shift+Enter` for a new line.
5. Watch the timeline for reasoning/status messages, assistant messages, tool calls, tool results, statistics, and modified-file summaries.

Useful first prompts:

```text
Summarize this repository and identify the main build/test commands.
```

```text
Inspect the failing test output below and propose the smallest safe fix.
```

## Add files to a prompt

Type `@` in the prompt editor to open the project file/folder picker. Accepted entries are inserted as Markdown links such as `[Program.cs](src/CodeAlta/Program.cs)` and are sent as structured attachments. Raw `@path`, quoted paths, and optional `:line` or `:start-end` suffixes are also recognized at send time.

Paste images with `Ctrl+V` when the selected model supports image input. CodeAlta opens a preview/title dialog and stores the image beside the session journal.
